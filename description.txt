Welcome to the Magnumiactus mod! 
This is a mod that currently focuses on expanding the throwing and summoning classes.
The throwing class gets several sets and pieces of equipment for Hardmode, making a playthrough much easier. 
There are non-consumable throwing weapons that consume mana, and you will see more of these the further you progress.
(The throwing items may be rather unbalanced compared to other classes, but I don't believe there's a vanilla standard for Hardmode throwing equipment.)
The summoning class gets some new pre-Plantera weapons (and other items) that may finally make it more viable.
A new NPC can move into town after defeating the Eye of Cthulhu, and his primary purpose is to sell throwing items. He may even sell a new kind of fragment when the time arises...
There are also additions for other classes.
