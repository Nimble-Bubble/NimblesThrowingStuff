Welcome to the Magnumiactus mod! 

This mod is a general content mod, with added content all throughout progression (including post-Moon Lord content) and an expansion to the Throwing class.
Now, you might be asking yourself: What makes this mod unique? While one could argue that no other mod is exactly like this, that's not really what we're looking for here.
A notable feature of this mod that you might not too often is tree-based crafting, in which a piece of equipment can have various routes to take for crafting. 
Instead of three small weapons slamming into each other to make one big and powerful weapon, one small weapon can be turned into one of three different big and powerful weapons with different materials.
This form of crafting is inspired by the Monster Hunter series, and something else that may seem familiar is the Lance weapon type. Each Lance is unique, so it may be worth it to try and get each and every one of them.

Additionally, the Throwing class is given a new form of weapon: Non-consumable (non-glove) Throwing weapons. Instead of consuming items from the inventory, non-consumable throwing weapons take mana to use.
While this rather unusually allocates a class-specific resource towards a completely different class, it may provide more structure to the Throwing experience.
To add onto that, a new NPC dedicated to the Throwing class has been added. A "living relic" of a species thought extinct, this NPC will help out quite a lot with its items through progression.
With the new items added to the Throwing class, you will most likely be able to get from the start of the game to the end much like any other class, though balance might become an issue.

0.3.2 expands further on the new content of 0.3.1, with further additions to weapon trees along with more shields.
